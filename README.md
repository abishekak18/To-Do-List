TO-DO List Project

This **To-Do List** web application allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as complete, with tasks saved in the browser's local storage so they persist across page reloads. The interface is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it lightweight and simple to use.

## Project Overview

This project helps users manage their daily tasks through a basic to-do list application. Tasks can be added, checked off when completed, or deleted. The list is saved in local storage, so users can close the application and still retain their list the next time they open it.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add tasks by typing in the input field and pressing "ADD."
- **Mark as Complete**: Tasks can be marked complete by clicking on them, applying a line-through style.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks by clicking the delete button (x) next to each item.
- **Persistent Data**: The app saves the to-do list in local storage, allowing tasks to persist even if the browser is closed.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the application
- **CSS**: Styling the to-do list interface
- **JavaScript**: Adding functionality to the to-do list (adding tasks, marking them as complete, deleting tasks, and saving data to local storage)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-list.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd todo-list
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your preferred browser** to view the application.

## Usage

1. Type a task into the input box labeled "Add Your Task."
2. Click the **ADD** button to add it to your task list.
3. Click on a task to mark it as complete (this will apply a line-through style).
4. Click the **x** button next to each task to delete it.
5. Refresh the page, and your tasks will still be there due to local storage.
